go-cache is an in-memory key:value store/cache similar to memcached that is
suitable for applications running on a single machine. Its major advantage is
that, being essentially a thread-safe map[string]interface{} with expiration
times, it doesn't need to serialize or transmit its contents over the network.

Any object can be stored, for a given duration or forever, and the cache can be
safely used by multiple goroutines.

Although go-cache isn't meant to be used as a persistent datastore, the entire
cache may be saved to and loaded from a file (or any io.Reader/Writer) to
recover from downtime quickly.

== Installation

go get github.com/pmylund/go-cache

== Usage

import "github.com/pmylund/go-cache"

// Create a cache with a default expiration time of 5 minutes, and which
// purges expired items every 30 seconds
c := cache.New(5*time.Minute, 30*time.Second)

// Set the value of the key "foo" to "bar", with the default expiration time
c.Set("foo", "bar", 0)

// Set the value of the key "baz" to 42, with no expiration time
// (the item won't be removed until it is re-set, or removed using
// c.Delete("baz")
c.Set("baz", 42, -1)

// Get the string associated with the key "foo" from the cache
foo, found := c.Get("foo")
if found {
        fmt.Println(foo)
}

// Since Go is statically typed, and cache values can be anything, type
// assertion is needed when values are being passed to functions that don't
// take arbitrary types, (i.e. interface{}). The simplest way to do this for
// values which will only be used once--e.g. for passing to another
// function--is:
foo, found := c.Get("foo")
if found {
        MyFunction(foo.(string))
}

// This gets tedious if the value is used several times in the same function.
// You might do either of the following instead:
if x, found := c.Get("foo"); found {
        foo := x.(string)
        ...
}
// or
var foo string
if x, found := c.Get("foo"); found {
        foo = x.(string)
}
...
// foo can then be passed around freely as a string

// Want performance? Store pointers!
c.Set("foo", &MyStruct, 0)
if x, found := c.Get("foo"); found {
        foo := x.(*MyStruct)
        ...
}

// If you store a reference type like a pointer, slice, map or channel, you
// do not need to run Set if you modify the underlying data. The cached
// reference points to the same memory, so if you modify a struct whose
// pointer you've stored in the cache, retrieving that pointer with Get will
// point you to the same data:
foo := &MyStruct{Num: 1}
c.Set("foo", foo, 0)
...
x, _ := c.Get("foo")
foo := x.(*MyStruct)
fmt.Println(foo.Num)
...
foo.Num++
...
x, _ := c.Get("foo")
foo := x.(*MyStruct)
foo.Println(foo.Num)

// will print:
1
2

== Reference

func New(de, ci time.Duration) *Cache
    Return a new cache with a given default expiration duration and cleanup
    interval. If the expiration duration is less than 1, the items in the cache
    never expire (by default), and must be deleted manually. If the cleanup
    interval is less than one, expired items are not deleted from the cache
    before their next lookup or before calling DeleteExpired.

func (c *Cache) Set(k string, x interface{}, d time.Duration)
    Add an item to the cache, replacing any existing item. If the duration is
    0, the cache's default expiration time is used. If it is -1, the item never
    expires.

func (c *Cache) Add(k string, x interface{}, d time.Duration) error
    Add an item to the cache only if an item doesn't already exist for the
    given key, or if the existing item has expired. Returns an error if not.

func (c *Cache) Replace(k string, x interface{}, d time.Duration) error
    Set a new value for the cache key only if it already exists. Returns an
    error if it does not.
